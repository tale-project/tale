/**
 * The version of the REST contract `/openapi.json` describes (`info.version`)
 * — semver for the wire, not for the deployment: a minor bump for an
 * additive change (a new operation, field, header or error code), a major
 * one for a removal or a changed meaning. Every `/api/v1` response carries
 * it as `X-Tale-Api-Version`, and `scripts/openapi/spec.test.ts` refuses a
 * contract whose operation or schema fingerprint moved without a bump, so
 * the number a client pins to cannot stay still while the surface changes.
 *
 * 1.4.0 — 2026-09-12: the 09-12 evaluation's contract changes (a blank
 * `cursor`/`limit` refused, key-less `OPTIONS`, `414` for an over-long URL,
 * declared response headers, `X-Tale-Api-Version`), on top of the nine
 * operations #3329 added under the unchanged 1.3.0.
