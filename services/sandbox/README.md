# @tale/sandbox

Tale sandbox spawner — a thin, stateless `docker run` service that launches
ephemeral `@tale/sandbox-runtime` containers for `artifact_run` (one container
per execute call, plus optional long-lived persistent sessions).

It mounts `/var/run/docker.sock` (host root — an accepted threat boundary) and
writes session state under the host session root mounted at
`/var/lib/tale-sandbox/sessions`.

```bash
bun run --filter @tale/sandbox dev    # bun --hot src/server.ts (local session root in /tmp)
bun run --filter @tale/sandbox test   # bun test
```

## Authentication

Every route except `GET /health` is HMAC-signed with the shared `SANDBOX_TOKEN`
(`src/auth.ts`, verified by `src/request-auth.ts`). The token is **required**:
the spawner refuses to start without it — it holds the host docker socket and
sits on the sandbox network every session container shares, so there is no
unsigned mode. `tale deploy` and `bun run dev` mint it into `.env`;
`compose.dev.yml` carries an insecure dev default for the dockerized dev stack.

The deploy's drain (`tale deploy` → `drainSandbox`) calls the control routes
through the signed client from **inside** the container, so the secret never
leaves it:

```bash
docker exec tale-sandbox bun /app/src/control-cli.ts drain          # refuse new sessions
docker exec tale-sandbox bun /app/src/control-cli.ts drain-status   # {draining, sessions, sessionIds}
```

## Container

`docker-entrypoint.sh` (PID 1, container-level bootstrap — ensures the host
session root exists) `exec`s `entrypoint.sh` (the bun server launch) so signals
reach the server directly. See the script headers for the split rationale.

```bash
# from repo root
docker build -f services/sandbox/Dockerfile .
```
