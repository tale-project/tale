# Error-code provocation map

Which error each surface can produce, and how to reach it deliberately. Used by
the suites when a box says "expect `<code>`", and as the checklist for "should
this code even be reachable from here?".

## Reachable from the UI

Each surfaces as a localized message the user can act on.

| Code | How to reach it |
|---|---|
| `<code>` | <the shortest deliberate path to it> |

## Reachable on the API surface only

Never a UI message — seeing one of these in the UI is itself a bug.

| Code | Where it shows up |
|---|---|
| `<code>` | <the request that produces it> |

## Must never appear

<The codes that mean the server gave up — a 500 and anything like it. There is
no repro by definition; any sighting is a finding.>

## Unreachable from the UI, still enforced

Codes the client-side guards intercept before the server ever answers. **Don't**
file a missing message; **do** confirm the server still refuses, by calling it
directly.

| Code | Guarded by | Proven by |
|---|---|---|
| `<code>` | <the client guard> | <the box that calls the server directly> |
