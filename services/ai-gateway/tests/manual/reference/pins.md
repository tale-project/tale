# Why a box says that

Each row below is an expectation a suite carries **because something once went
wrong**. The box itself states only the check, so it stays readable; the reason
lives here.

Read this **before you reword, merge or delete a box** — an oddly specific
expectation is usually specific on purpose. Read it too when a box fails and you
want to know what class of defect it was written to catch.

Rows marked `docs` are corrections to this guide rather than to the product: the
box used to ask for something unreachable or wrong, and a round proved it. They
stay so nobody re-introduces the old wording.

**Adding a row:** when a round sharpens a box, add the row here in the same
change as the box edit. Key it by box ID, state the mechanism (not the symptom),
and name the test that now holds it. Never key a row by round — the journal in
[`../runs`](../runs) records rounds, this register records product knowledge.

## <Suite>

| Box | What it pins |
|---|---|
| `<PREFIX>-1` | <the mechanism that made the old behaviour wrong> |
