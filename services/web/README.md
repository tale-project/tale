## Configuration

All config is read from `process.env` — no `.env` is required, defaults work out
of the box. Set these at deploy time (compose, systemd, K8s), or via a local
`.env` if you prefer:

- `PORT` — HTTP listen port (default `3001`; the Dockerfile already sets it).
- `WEB_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` — enables the Contact / Request Demo forms
  (`/api/forms/submit` forwards a Discord embed here). If unset, the endpoint
  returns `503` and the forms are disabled. Create one in Discord via Server
  Settings → Connectors → Webhooks → New Webhook.
- `WEB_FORMS_REQUIRED` — when `true`, `/api/health` returns `503` if
  `WEB_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` is unset so deploy health checks catch the
  misconfiguration before users do. Recommended for production tale.dev.
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` / `GH_TOKEN` — optional, build-time only: raises the GitHub
  API rate limit for `fetch-releases`. The runtime release feed is always
  unauthenticated, so no deployment needs a token.

## Changelog data

`/changelog` renders two layers of the same GitHub Releases list:

- **Build-time snapshot** — `fetch-releases` writes
  `app/generated/releases-manifest.ts`, which the prerendered HTML and the
  SEO/LLM artifacts embed. This is also the offline fallback.
- **Runtime feed** — `GET /api/releases` (`lib/releases/feed.ts`) re-fetches
  the list on a 30-minute TTL and the page swaps it in after hydration.

Both layers are needed: release images are built _before_ the release workflow
publishes the GitHub release, so a snapshot alone is always at least one
release behind. Reads never block on GitHub — a failed refresh keeps the last
good list (or the snapshot) and backs off.
